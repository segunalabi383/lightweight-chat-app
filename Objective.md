Objective
Create a lightweight next.js app where a user can input a prompt, submit it to an AI API (e.g., OpenAI), and receive/display a response. Focus on:

- Prompt input + submit button
- Fetching from OpenAI or HuggingFace
- Displaying results dynamically
- Error handling and loading states

Bonus (+10 pts)
- Save and show past prompts/responses (chat history)
- Include a “Clear” button for the user
